                        ObjectiveExpat, Release 1.95.8

This is ObjectiveExpat - formerly known as simply Expat for ObjectiveC.
It is an ObjectiveC wrapper for Expat, a C library for parsing XML, 
written by James Clark.

Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser.  This means that you register
handlers with the parser before starting the parse.  These handlers
are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the
document being parsed.  A start tag is an example of the kind of
structures for which you may register handlers.

ObjectiveExpat contains an abstract class TBXmlParser which wraps the 
Expat parser and installs all of the callbacks for you.  The callbacks
then invoke messages on the TBXmlParser.  The implementation of the 
methods is empty.  Subclass and override the methods to perform custom
handling and implement concrete parsers.

A subclass of TBXmlParser called TBXmlPListParser is provided as an 
example of a concrete XmlParser implementation.  It uses PList objects
(NSDictionary, NSArray, NSString) as the Document Object Model (DOM).
This is pretty much the only parser object I have ever needed but you
are free do develop your own.

Expat and ObjectiveExpat is free software.  You may copy, distribute, 
and modify it under the terms of the License contained in the file COPYING 
distributed with this package.  This license is the same as the MIT/X 
Consortium license.  If you use this package, I would appreciate an email and 
a mention in the developer credits along the lines of "Xml Parser interface
by Todd Blanchard" as this sort of thing makes it easier for me to find work
and without work there is no free software.  :-)

Versions of Expat that have an odd minor version (the middle number in
the release above), are development releases and should be considered
as beta software.  Releases with even minor version numbers are
intended to be production grade software.
